## Bubble Sort

> Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case time complexity is quite high.

- Time Complexity : For Worst and Avergae - O(n2), for Best O(n)

## Insertion Sort

> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

- Time Complexity : For Worst and Avergae - O(n2), for Best O(n)

## Selection Sort

> The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
> The subarray which is already sorted.
> Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

- Time Complexity : For Worst and Avergae - O(n2)
